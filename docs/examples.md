# Examples


In the [examples](./examples) directory are many exemples, including all of the
function-go-templating examples implemented using function-pythonic.
The [eks-cluster](./examples/eks-cluster/composition.yaml) example is a good
complex example creating the entire vpc structure needed for an EKS cluster.
